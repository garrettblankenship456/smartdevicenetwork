This is a side project because im bored. It will allow devices like raspberry pi's to control multiple arduinos to do things real life, while having the raspberry pis controlled via a server or something.

The server will have a few utilities made for a user to push updates to the raspberry pis and such, while the server runs and handles all the communication between them all.

The server will be made in nodeJS and both the device and user utilities will be made in C++, though could change in the future.
