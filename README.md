This is a side project because im bored. It will allow devices like raspberry pi's to control multiple arduinos to do things real life, while having the raspberry pis controlled via a server or something.

The server will have a few utilities made for a user to push updates to the raspberry pis and such, while the server runs and handles all the communication between them all.
